## Overview
getITD was developed for FLT3-ITD detection from Illumina sequencing data. Adaptations to data generated by similar assays, sequencing technologies or target regions should be possible. In fact, getITD was successfully used to analyze 454 data of different amplicons as presented at ASH 2018 (Rücker et al. "Prognostic Impact of Insertion Site in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with FLT3 Internal Tandem Duplication: Results from the Ratify Study (Alliance 10603)".).

The core getITD analysis program is contained within getitd.py. 
In addition, two wrapper scripts, make_getitd_config.py and getitd_from_config_wrapper.py, which do not require use of the commandline are provided to facilitate getITD analysis. 

Setup and usage of all programs is described in detail below.


## Requirements
python3
- pandas
- numpy
- biopython
- easygui

The pandas, numpy and biopython modules are required for the core getITD program. The easygui module is optional and only required by the make_getitd_config.py script.


## Setup (Linux / Ubuntu & MacOS)
#### If applicable: Set proxy
In case you are working behind a firewall, set the appropriate proxy server (ask your IT administrator if you do not know which one this is) by opening the commandline and entering the following commands:
```
export https_proxy=your.proxy.server:your_port
export http_proxy=your.proxy.server:your_port
```
#### Python3 modules
To install the necessary python3 modules, open the commandline and enter:
```
pip3 install --user numpy pandas biopython easygui
```

##### For convenience: Change to the folder containing the _getitd.py_ program and _anno_ subfolder
Commands provided in this manual assume that you are working from within the folder that contains the _getitd.py_ script. Your current folder is shown at the beginning of the commandline. To go up in the folder hierarchy, enter:
```
cd ..
```
To enter a certain subfolder, type:
```
cd EXAMPLE
```
(Replace _EXAMPLE_ with the name of the folder you are trying to enter.)

Repeat these two steps to reach the desired destination.


Alternatively, provide full or relative paths to all files, including the _getitd.py_ script, input FASTQ files and reference and annotation files, whenever you use getITD. 

## Setup (Windows)
#### Python3
If necessary, download and install the latest python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. Be sure to check the box to add it to your PATH. Check that python works by opening the Windows commandline (cmd), typing
```
py -3
```
and pressing ENTER. If python3 was correctly installed and added to your PATH, this will open the python interpreter. Exit by typing 
```
exit()
```
and pressing ENTER.

#### Visual Studio C++ Build Tools
Download and install Visual Studio C++ Build tools from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools (click _Download Build Tools_, scroll down to _All Downloads_ and select _Build Tools for Visual Studio_ under _Tools for Visual Studio_). 

For installation, select the following options in addition to the defaults:
- "C++/CLI support"
- "VC++ 2015.3 v14.00 (v140) toolset for desktop"

#### If applicable: Set proxy
In case you are working behind a firewall, set the appropriate proxy server (ask your IT administrator if you do not know which one this is) by entering the following commands in the Windws commandline (cmd):
```
set https_proxy=your.proxy.server:your_port
set http_proxy=your.proxy.server:your_port
```

#### Install python3 modules:
Open the Windows commandline (cmd) and install the required python3 modules:
```
pip3 install --user pandas numpy biopython easygui
```
If this command fails with a connection error such as the one shown below, you are working behind a firewall and first need to set the correct proxy server as described above under _Set proxy_):
```
Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x00000218168F2A90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it')': /simple/pandas/
```
#### For convenience: Change to the folder containing the _getitd.py_ program and _anno_ subfolder
Commands provided in this manual assume that you are working from within the folder that contains the _getitd.py_ script. Your current folder is shown at the beginning of the commandline. To go up in the folder hierarchy, enter:
```
cd ..
```
To enter a certain subfolder, type:
```
cd EXAMPLE
```
(Replace _EXAMPLE_ with the name of the folder you are trying to enter.)

Repeat these two steps to reach the desired destination.


Alternatively, provide full or relative paths to all files, including the _getitd.py_ script, input FASTQ files and reference and annotation files, whenever you use getITD. 

## getITD core program
### Input
###### Required:
The only required inputs are a sample ID to name output files and folders and the actual FASTQ files containing the sequencing data to process. Supply these in the correct order (see also the examples below):

| Position | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | *sample ID* which is used for naming  of output files and folders. This parameter is *required*. |
| 2nd | Path and filename of the FASTQ file containing forward reads to process, by convention the _R1_ FASTQ file. When processing single-end sequencing data, supply the single FASTQ file that was generated. This parameter is *required*. |
| 3rd | Path and filename of the FASTQ file containing reverse reads to process, by convention the _R2_ FASTQ file generated by paired-end sequencing. This parameter is *optional*. |

###### Optional:
Many optional parameters are available to customize the analysis:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-reference X` | Path and filename of the reference to align to. This file should contain a single line of text, namely the WT sequence of the amplicon that was processed. getITD aligns all reads to this reference and detects insertions and ITDs relative to it. Default: _./anno/amplicon.txt_. |
| `-anno X` | Path and filename of the annotation file used to retrieve chromosomal, transcriptomic and proteomic coordinates and domains for each insertion and ITD identified by getITD. Columns should be tab-separated with header _amplicon_bp_, _region_, _chr_bp_, _transcript_bp_, _protein_as_. Default: _./anno/amplicon_kayser.tsv_. | 
| `-forward_primer X` | Gene-specific sequence(s) of the forward primer(s) used to generate the sequenced amplicon. The sequence should be identical to the 5' end of supplied forward reads. When sequencing a pool of multiple amplicons, provide information on all primer pairs used. Separate individual sequences by space. Default: _GCAATTTAGGTATGAAAGCCAGCTAC_. |
| `-reverse_primer X` | Gene-specific sequence(s) of the reverse primer(s) used. This sequence should be identical to the 5' end of supplied reverse reads. When sequencing a pool of multiple amplicons, provide information on all primer pairs used. Separate individual sequences by space. Default: _CTTTCAGCATTTTGACGGCAACC_. |
| `-require_indel_free_primers X` | If True, discard reads containing insertions or deletions within the primer sequence, as these indicate low sequence fidelity. Note that, if set to _True_, this also filters reads not containing any primer sequence at all, so this must be set to _False_ in case primers have been trimmed. Note that adapters but not primers should be trimmed. Default: _True_. |
| `-forward_adapter X` | Sequencing adapter of the forward reads' primer as (potentially) present at the 5' end of the supplied forward reads, 5' of the gene-specific primer sequence. Default: _TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGA_. |
| `-reverse_adapter X` | Sequencing adapter of the reverse reads' primer as (potentially) present at the 5' end of the supplied reverse reads, 5' of the gene-specific primer sequence. Default: _GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGA_. |
| `-technology X` | Sequencing technology used, options are _454_ and _Illumina_. Currently this has no effect for Illumina data. For 454 data, the reads' sense, that is whether they are forward or reverse reads, is inferred from alignment. Default: _Illumina_. |
| `-nkern X` | The number of cores to use for parallel tasks. Set to 1 to disable parallelization. Default: _12_. |
| `-gap_open X` | Alignment cost of a gap opening. Default: _-36_ |
| `-gap_extend X` | Alignment cost of a gap extension. Default: _-0.5_ |
| `-match X` | Alignment cost of a base match. Default: _5_ |
| `-mismatch X` | Alignment cost of a base mismatch. Default: _-15_ |
| `-minscore_inserts X` | Fraction of the maximum possible alignment score required between inserts and respective WT tandems when deciding whether these are sufficiently similar to consider them ITDs and inserts supported by distinct reads when determining whether these are supporting the same mutation or not. Higher values will require sequences in both cases to be more similar. Default: _0.5_. |
| `-minscore_alignments X` | Fraction of the maximum possible alignment score required between each read and the reference. Reads that do not pass this filter are discarded to eliminate low fidelity sequences. Default: _0.5_. |
| `-min_bqs X` | Minimum average base quality score (BQS) required by each read. Reads that do not pass this filter are discarded to eliminate sequences likely to contain sequencing errors. Default: _30_. |
| `-min_read_length X` | Minimum read length required by each read. This filter is applied after trailing _N_ bases are trimmed at both the 5' and 3' end. Reads that do not pass this filter are discarded. Default: _100_. |
| `-min_read_copies X` | Minimum number of copies of each read required for processing. When set to _2_, all unique read sequences are discarded, based on the assumption that _true_ and _clinically relevant_ sequences will be present at least twice. Disable this filter, by setting it to _1_, when not all reads have the same length as it will otherwise incorrectly discard the majority of input reads. Default: _2_. | 
| `-filter_ins_unique_reads X` | Minimum number of unique supporting reads required for an insertion / ITD to be considered _high confidence_. Disable this filter by setting it to _1_. Default: _2_. | 
| `-filter_ins_total_reads X` | Minimum number of total supporting reads required for an insertion / ITD to be considered _high confidence_. Default: _1_ (disabled). |
| `-filter_ins_vaf X` | Minimum variant allele frequency (VAF), in percent, required for an insertion / ITD to be considered _high confidence_. |

### Output 
##### Files
For each sample, an output directory will be created in the current directory, named using the provided sample ID. 
Inside, all of the generated output files reside:
- config.txt contains parameters, date and time of the analysis
- stats.txt contains the number of reads and insertions / ITDs processed and filtered at each step of the analysis
- out\_needle/ contains individual alignment files, needle\_\*.txt, of all the different reads processed
- itds\_collapsed-is-same\_is-similar\_is-close\_is-same-trailing\_hc.tsv contains filtered high-confidence (hc) ITDs, fully merged
- itds\_collapsed-is-same\_is-similar\_is-close\_is-same-trailing.tsv contains all ITDs, fully merged
- itds\_collapsed-is-same\_is-similar\_is-close.tsv contains all ITDs, having merged those of the same insertion length, nearby insertion sites (within one tandem length) and similar insert sequences 
- itds\_collapsed-is-same\_is-similar.tsv contains all ITDs, having merged those of the same insertion length and site and similar insert sequences
- itds\_collapsed-is-same.tsv contains all ITDs, having merged those that share the same insertion length, site and sequence
- insertions\*.tsv files are analogous to ITD files but list all insertions, regardless of whether these are also ITDs or not

##### On stdout
At each filtering step, the number of reads and insertions passing the specified requirements are printed. This basically corresponds to the content of _stats.txt_.
Currently, also the computation time of various steps is printed, but presumably this will change in the future. 

### Example

#### Changing optional parameters
To change, for example, the  number of cores used for the analysis to _2_, on Linux / MacOS instead run:
```
python3 getitd.py -nkern=2 test test/test_R1.fastq test/test_R2.fastq
```
On Windows, run:
```
py -3 getitd.py -nkern=2 test test\test_R1.fastq test\test_R2.fastq
```

### How it works
1. Read in FASTQ files
    - Read in forward reads and BQS (R1)
    - Read in and reverse complement reverse reads and BQS (R2)
    - Trim trailing ambiguous N bases on all reads
2. Filter reads for minimum average base quality score (BQS)
    - Discard low quality reads
3. Filter unique reads
    - Assume that true & clinically relevant sequences will be present at least twice and discard unique reads
4. Align each read to the WT amplicon reference sequence using Needlemann-Wunsch alignment algorithm
5. Filter alignments, require
    - at least 50 % of the maximum possible alignment score
    - gap-free alignment to the primer sequence (when these are given)
6. Collect insertions within passing alignments, require
    - insert length of at least 6 bp
    - absence of ambiguous "N" bases within the actual insert sequence
    - in-frame insert (length divisible by 3) for inserts fully contained within a read
    - 3' or 5' trailing inserts not fully spanned by the sequenced reads are not required to be in-frame, since their exact length is not actually known then
7. Collect ITDs from passing insertions, require
    - insert sequence can be realigned to the WT amplicon sequence, again with at least 50 % of the maximum possible alignment score
    - for 3' and 5' trailing inserts that insert sequence is not an adapter artefact
8. Merge total insertions and ITDs independently (considering reads to describe the same event and adding up supporting counts), require
    - that they are actually the same: insert length, site and sequence are identical
    - that they are similar: insert length and site are the same, sequences are similar
    - that they are close: insert length is the same, sequences are similar and sites are within one insert length of each other
    - close trailing inserts with similar sequences are considered the same regardless of their (estimated) lengths
9. Filter insertions and ITDs independently, require
    - at least two different supporting reads
    - a minimum variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.006 %


## getITD wrappers - running getITD without the commandline 
Two additional scripts are provided to facilitate getITD analysis by alleviating the need to use the commandline. The first, make_getitd_config.py, when double-clicked, creates a simple graphical interface and asks the user to select desired analysis parameters and annotation / reference files. These parameters are then saved to a config.txt file. When this config.txt is placed in a folder containing both getitd_from_config_wrapper.py and an arbitrary number of FASTQ files to analyze, double-clicking the wrapper script will initiate sequential analysis of all of the provided FASTQ files using parameters stored in config.txt. Though these wrapper scripts were originally intended primarily to facilitate analysis on Windows, they run also on Linux and Mac.
